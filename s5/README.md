# ðŸŒŸ Introduction to PyTorch and Neural Network

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This is the folder is created as the solution for the Assignment 5 which is part of the ERAv2. 

## ðŸ—‚ Files in the Repository

- `ðŸ““ S5.ipynb`: This Jupyter notebook contains the main code for training and evaluating the neural network model. It includes data preprocessing, model architecture definition, training loops, and visualization of training/test metrics. 

- `ðŸ§  model.py`: Defines the neural network architecture. This Python script includes the definition of layers, forward pass logic, and any additional functions needed to describe the model's structure.

- `ðŸ”§ utils.py`: Contains utility functions and classes used throughout the project. This includes data transformations, device configuration (CPU/GPU), and any other helper functions that streamline the code in the notebook.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Matplotlib (for plotting)
- torchvision (for data transformations and datasets)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourprojectname.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install torch torchvision matplotlib
```

### Running the Project
To run the project, open the `S5.ipynb` notebook in a Jupyter environment:
```bash
jupyter notebook S5.ipynb
```
Follow the instructions within the notebook to train and evaluate the model.
